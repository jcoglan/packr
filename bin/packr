  description <<-EOS
  PackR is a program for compressing JavaScript programs. It can remove whitespace
  and comments, compress local variable names, compress/obfuscate private identifiers,
  and encode the program in base-62.
  
  When invoked from the command line, it concatenates all the code in INPUT_FILES (or
  from standard input) and compresses the code using the given options, printing the
  result to standard output. You can pipe this output into another file to save it.

  :desc => 'Shrink local variable names inside functions'
  
  flag    :private,         :default => false,
  :desc => 'Obfuscate private identifiers, i.e. names beginning with a single underscore'
  
  flag    :base62,          :default => false,
  :desc => 'Encode the program using base 62'
  
  array   :protect,         :default => [],
  :desc => 'List of variable names to protect from compression when using --shrink-vars'
  
  notes <<-EOS
  This program is not a JavaScript parser, and rewrites your files using regular
  expressions. Be sure to include semicolons and braces everywhere they are required
  so that your program will work correctly when packed down to a single line.
  
  By far the most efficient way to serve JavaScript over the web is to use PackR
  with the --shrink-vars flag, combined with gzip compression. If you don't have access
  to your server config to set up mod_deflate, you can generate gzip files using
  (on Unix-like systems):
  
    packr -s my-file.js | gzip > my-file.js.gz
    
  You can then get Apache to serve the files by putting this in your .htaccess file:
  
    AddEncoding gzip .gz
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Accept-encoding} gzip
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} !Safari
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}.gz -f
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1.gz [QSA,L]
  
  If you really cannot serve gzip files, use the --base62 option to further compress
  your code. This mode is at its best when compressing large files with many repeated
  tokens.
  
  The --private option can be used to stop other programs calling private methods
  in your code by renaming anything beginning with a single underscore. Beware that
  you should not use this if the generated file contains 'private' methods that need
  to be accessible by other files. Also know that all the files that access any
  particular private method must be compressed together so they all get the same
  rewritten name for the private method.
